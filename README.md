Bitcoin Block RNG
What This Project Does

Bitcoin Block RNG is a website that uses the hash of newly mined Bitcoin blocks to generate random numbers.
Because Bitcoin block's final hash can’t be predicted in advance, this method provides transparent and publicly verifiable randomness.

How It Works (Simple Version)

You tell the site how many random numbers you want, and the range (like 1–100).

You choose whether to use 1 block or several consecutive blocks (up to 5) for more randomness.

The site waits until the next block(s) are mined.

It takes the block hash (a long string of letters and numbers) and converts it into your random number(s).

You get the result along with the block hash so anyone can verify it.

Why Use Bitcoin for Randomness?

Transparent – The block hash is public information on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Verifiable – Anyone can check the result using the hash and the formula shown on the site.

Not Controlled by Us – The randomness comes from the Bitcoin network, not from our own server.

Limitations & Risks

Miner Influence – A Bitcoin miner could technically choose to withhold or modify a block to influence the number.

For 1 block, the cost to manipulate is the coinbase payout, plus transaction fees of that block.

Using more blocks (K > 1) makes manipulation harder and more expensive, but also increases waiting time.

Time Delay – Blocks are mined about every 10 minutes on average. If you select more than 1 block, the wait is longer.

Recommendations

For casual use, 1 block is usually fine.

For high-stakes randomness, choose more blocks (K=3–5) to reduce the risk of manipulation.

Always verify the result using the block hash and the steps provided on the site.
